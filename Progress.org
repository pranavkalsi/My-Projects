This file contains project progress including goals, todo items, problems and Questions.

Relevant reading notes are maintained here [[file:Project_reading.org][Reading notes]].

* First Goals:
** DONE Understand Basics from the paper
** CANCELLED Replicate the results obtained in the paper?
** STARTED Check if the data file has data of all the stars which are cluster members.
The Data was imported as a python dataframe, there were total 3960 stars. The jupyter file can be found here:
[[file:NGC_1960.html]] 
The Vector-point Diagram for propermotion was zoomed and displayed as in [cite:@joshi20_photom_kinem_variab_study_young].

* Questions, Problems and Doubts:
** Direclty related to the work
*** TODO GIA-DR3 has only handful of stars/sources with non-nan Radial velocity 
Out of a search query of 10000 sources in a radius of 14.49 arc-min around centre co-ordinates of NGC 1960, there were 9320 for which GIA data was available out of which only *285* had non-nan radial velocity data.
** May deviate:
*** TODO Radial profiles of star clusters in galaxies
    The figure 2 in [cite:@joshi20_photom_kinem_variab_study_young].
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE 
    Figure 2. The radial distribution of stellar number density in the proper-
motion plane. Here, dashed horizontal line indicates the field density and
vertical dotted line represents the cut-off radius used to find the cluster
members.

We fit the stellar density profile with a function similar to the one used to characterize the radial profiles of star clusters in the galaxies.
